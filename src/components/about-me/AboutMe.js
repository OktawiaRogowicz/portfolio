                        Since February 2022, I have a BS in Computer Science from Technical University of Lodz. In my thesis I aimed to learn more about neural networks and inspiration came quickly - I decided to take upon a challenge and recreate Quick, Draw! made by Google using technologies I have not used before. Turns out I really enjoyed React and, once again, the process of designing a website - and I decided to try and change from back-end to front-end developer.

                        Privately I draw since I was young - I even once thought it will become my career! I love to cook and last year completed a challenge of testing out one hundred new recipes. Iâ€™m a big fan of board games, books, and indie music.
